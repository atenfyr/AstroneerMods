# Atenfyr's Astroneer Mods
This is a dump of the source code for all of the blueprint-focused Astroneer mods that I created while I was still actively modding the game (see the Content/Atenfyr directory).

You will likely need to install the [AstroTechies ModdingKit](https://github.com/AstroTechies/ModdingKit) to use this source code. You can find guides on doing so from the Astroneer Modding Discord community: [https://discord.gg/bBqdVYxu4k](https://discord.gg/bBqdVYxu4k)

Since I have permanently retired from the Astroneer Modding scene and have no further attachment to it or any of my prior work within it, I have released all the source code within this repository into the public domain. See [the LICENSE file](https://github.com/atenfyr/AstroneerMods/blob/master/LICENSE) for more information.
